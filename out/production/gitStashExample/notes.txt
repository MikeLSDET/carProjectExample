What is stashing?
saving our codes to a temporary area for later use is called stashing!!!


Why do we need stashing?
1. you are working on a new test feature that you don't want yet to be in the commits because you are not sure
whether it will be working or not!

2. in order to update your local repo in sync with
 the remote repo, without discarding the changes in working directory

 -------THE PROJECT-----

 write down the code to make a beautiful car!!
